This PRD outlines the development of the **CA Monk Blog Application**, a modern web platform designed to showcase technical proficiency in React, TypeScript, and state management.

---

## 1. Project Overview

The objective is to build a high-performance, responsive blog management system. The application will serve as a dual-pane interface where users can browse a feed of financial and tech-related content, view detailed articles, and contribute new posts.

### Core Objectives

* **Seamless Data Fetching:** Implement TanStack Query for robust server-state synchronization.
* **Modern UI/UX:** Leverage shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS for a polished, professional aesthetic.
* **Reliability:** Provide clear feedback through loading skeletons and error boundaries.

## 2. Target Features & Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Blog Exploration (Read)

| Feature | Description | Endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Blog Feed** | A left-panel list displaying blog cards with category, title, and short description. | `GET /blogs` |
| **Detail View** | A right-panel view triggered by selecting a card, showing the cover image, date, and full content. | `GET /blogs/:id` |
| **State Feedback** | Implementation of Skeleton loaders during fetch and "Toast" or alert messages for API errors. | N/A |

### 2.2 Content Creation (Write)

* **Creation Form:** A dedicated interface (or modal) to input blog title, categories, description, and content.
* **Query Invalidation:** Upon a successful `POST /blogs`, the application must automatically refetch the blog list to show the new entry immediately.
* **Schema Validation:** Ensure all required fields (Title, Category, Description) are captured before submission.

## 3. Technical Specifications

### The Tech Stack (Compulsory)

* **Language:** TypeScript (Strict typing for blog objects).
* **Framework:** React.js.
* **State Management:** TanStack Query (QueryClient, UseQuery, UseMutation).
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
* **Component Library:** shadcn/ui (Cards, Buttons, Inputs, Skeletons).
* **Backend:** JSON Server (Localhost:3001).

### Data Model

The application will handle objects structured as follows:

```json
{
  "id": number,
  "title": "string",
  "category": ["string[]"],
  "description": "string",
  "date": "ISO-8601 string",
  "coverImage": "url_string",
  "content": "string"
}

```

## 4. User Interface (UI) Design

The layout follows a **Master-Detail Pattern**:

* **Left Sidebar (Master):** Scrollable list of cards. Each card highlights the `category` tags and `description`.
* **Main Content (Detail):** Occupies the remaining screen real estate. Displays the `coverImage` prominently at the top, followed by the `title` and the `content` body in plain text.
* **Responsiveness:** The layout should stack vertically on mobile devices for optimal readability.

---

## 5. Success Criteria & Acceptance Tests

* [ ] **Zero-Refresh Updates:** New blogs appear in the list without a manual page reload.
* [ ] **Type Safety:** No `any` types used in the data fetching layer.
* [ ] **Empty States:** The UI gracefully handles scenarios where no blogs are returned from the API.
* [ ] **Loading States:** Skeletons are visible for at least a split second during initial data fetch to prevent layout shift.

> **Pro Tip:** Since navigation is optional, using **React Router** to link `/blogs/:id` will significantly improve the "User Experience" score mentioned in the evaluation criteria.
